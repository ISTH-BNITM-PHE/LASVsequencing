REAL-TIME LASSA VIRUS SEQUENCING IN NIGERIA, 2018

The Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH), Edo State, Nigeria, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM), Hamburg, Germany, and Public Health England (PHE), UK, are committed to sharing data in public health emergencies. We release unpublished Lassa virus sequences from Nigeria to support the public health response as well as the development and evaluation of Lassa fever diagnostics or therapeutics. The data may be used and analyzed for these purposes. It is not permitted to use the sequences for publication, i.e. any type of communication with the general public that describes data generated with the use of the sequences. If you intend to so, please contact us directly.
